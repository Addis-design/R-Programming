#Question 2
=====
#
```{r}
#2 a
#Fatalities=123.98+0.091×CellPlans
#In this regression model:
 # • Intercept (123.98) represents the estimated number of fatalities when the number of cell   plans (CellPlans) is zero. 
#• Coefficient on CellPlans (0.091) is the estimated change in the number of fatalities for a one-unit increase in the number of cell phone plans. It suggests that, on average, for each additional cell phone plan, there is an expected increase of 0.091 in the number of fatalities.Fatalities=−3557.08+515.81×ln(CellPlans)

```

#

```{r}
#2 b)
#
#In this regression model:
 # • Intercept (-3557.08) Similar to the intercept in the previous model, represents the estimated number of fatalities when the natural logarithm of the number of cell phone plans (ln(CellPlans)) is zero.  
#• Coefficient on ln(CellPlans) (515.81) is the estimated change in the number of fatalities for a one-unit increase in the natural logarithm of the number of cell phone plans. The natural logarithm transformation is often used to address issues of scale, and in this context, the coefficient represents the percentage change in fatalities associated with a 1% increase in the number of cell phone plans.

#

```


```{r}
#2 c) ln(Fatalities)=5.43+0.0001×CellPlans
#In this regression model:
#  • Intercept (5.43) refers to what is considered as a natural logarithm of fatalities where CellPlans equals 0. 
#• Coefficient on CellPlans (0.0001): The estimated change in death’s natural logarithm for each additional plan.This means that every unit increase of cell phones plans is likely to add such a minimal rise in the fatalities.

```

```{r}
#2 d) ln(Fatalities)=−0.89+0.85×ln(CellPlans)
#In this regression model:
#  • Intercept (-0.89): It similarly mirrors the intercept of the last model reflecting the predicted natural logarithm of deaths when the natural logarithm of number of cellplans (ln(Cellplans)) equals to zero.
#• Coefficient on ln(CellPlans) (0.85): Depicts the predicted number of deaths per unit shift in the ln fatalities for a rise in the ln number of mobile subscriptions. The coefficient signifies the rate of increase in fatalities due to one percent increase in the number of phone plans.

#Question 3

# Display the result

```



```{r}
#5 C
#Coefficient for the product of the interaction term educ × pareduc
#educ × pareduc shows a negative value of -0.036 in the regression model. The interaction term includes the influence that own education (educ) and parental education (pareduc) exert upon workers’ earnings simultaneously. Negative sign of the coefficient represents the fact that in the present study, the rate of profitability for education lowers when parents’ education level becomes high. This means that the effect of another year added in educational process is lower if parents’ education is higher. Therefore it means there is a negative cross-effect whereby the earnings from education depend on parent’s education

```



```{r}

# Standard error for the interaction term
