# Calculate and display correlation coefficient to assess the relationship

cat("Correlation Coefficient (Price vs. Year):", correlation_coefficient, "\n")


#Yes, there is a relation between the price and the year of the cars. As the year of the car increases (i.e., the cars are newer), the price tends to be higher. On average, newer cars are more expensive.
